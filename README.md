# smoothstate-onepager
A Kirby based single-page website using Smoothstate.js

Template was originally built for an architect client, but he ended up not using it.

In hindsight, this probably should've been built with React or Vue, and not with this weird Smoothstate set-up. It feels kinda wonky but it was needed to meet the clients demand at that time.
